This program does 3 things, depending on the values in zf_config.yaml :

- link photoes out of photosets into collections based on various
  criteria
- make reduced-resolution copies of pictures based on various
  criteria, for me to carry around on my phone
- forcibly sort photosets by a given order (because Zenfolio doesn't
  preserve order when new photos are added ;_;)

This is a thing I wrote for myself, and I have no idea if anyone else will find it useful.  The reason I'm publishing it is because:

1.  With the Zenfolio forums gone (*sigh*), there are basically no examples of Zenfolio API usage on the net
2.  Since Zenfolio *still* doesn't have automatic / smart collectinos, and when the forums *were* up people kept asking for that, maybe someone else will find value in this.

If you actually end up using this, please let me know ( robinleepowell [at] gmail.com ) as it is likely to change how I treat this code.  :)   Feel free to post github issues, too; I will see those.
